# Introduction to R workshop (2022)

Note: Until further notice, workshops will be taught online via Zoom. However, we anticipate returning to in-person teaching in 2022.

### **Workshop dates and times:**

**Tuesday, April 19th**: 10 AM - 12 PM

**Friday, April 22nd**: 10 AM - 12 PM

**Tuesday, April 26th**: 10 AM - 12 PM

**Friday, April 29th**: 10 AM - 12 PM


Instruction will be mostly learner-centric, **requiring workshop participants to spend between 2-3 hours on reading and exercises from selected lessons between the workshop sessions.** *Online (Zoom) and in-person classes will be focused on exercises and discussion, and participants are expected to attend all four sessions*. Please make sure you take this into account when you sign up for the workshop!

### **Description:**
This **hands-on** workshop will introduce participants to using R and RStudio. R is a simple programming environment that enables the effective handling of data, while providing excellent graphical support. RStudio is a tool that provides a user-friendly environment for working with R.

This workshop is intended to provide basic R programming knowledge. Participants should be interested in:

learning the basics of R for reproducible data wrangling and visualizations (ggplot2)
performing data analyses requiring a basic knowledge of R
learning R to take an advanced workshop with us on the analysis of sequencing data in the next 6-8 months
Workshop segments will address the following:

- **R syntax**: Understanding the different 'parts of speech' in R; introducing variables and functions, demonstrating how functions work, and modifying arguments for specific use cases.
- **Data structures in R**: Getting a handle on the classes of data structures and the types of data used by R.
- **Data inspection and wrangling**: Reading in data from files. Using indices and various functions to subset and create datasets, including the tidyverse suite of packages.
- **Visualizing data**: Visualizing data using plotting functions from the external package ggplot2.
- **Exporting data and graphics**: Generating new data tables and plots for use outside of the R environment.
In addition to the above, we will focus on good data management practices, installing and working with data wrangling and visualization packages, and the different ways to get help when coding in R. After this workshop participants can expect to be comfortable with the basics of data wrangling and plotting using R. 

Prerequisites?
This is one of our basic workshops, and has NO prerequisites and no prior programming experience is required. 

This workshop (or fluency in R) is a prerequisite for advanced workshops introducing the analysis of bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data.

Who should attend?
Eligible* Harvard researchers who: 

want to learn how to use R and RStudio for data wrangling and visualizations
desire to perform data analysis methods where basic knowledge of R is a requirement
are interested in taking an advanced workshop with us on analysis of sequencing data within the next 6 - 8 months
Cost and Registration:
There is a non-refundable and non-transferable $35 registration fee for this online workshop.

We will be accepting 40-45 participants on a first-come, first-served basis:

If you are one of the first 40-45 eligible* registrants, you will receive an email within 1 week with a link to pay the (non-refundable & non-transferable) $35 registration fee.
