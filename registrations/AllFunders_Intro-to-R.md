### **Description:**
This **hands-on** workshop will introduce participants to using R and RStudio. R is a simple programming environment that enables the effective handling of data, while providing excellent graphical support. RStudio is a tool that provides a user-friendly environment for working with R.

This workshop is intended to provide basic R programming knowledge. Participants should be interested in:

- learning the basics of R for reproducible data wrangling and visualizations (ggplot2)
- performing data analyses requiring a basic knowledge of R
- learning R to take an advanced workshop with us on the analysis of sequencing data in the next 6-8 months


Workshop segments will address the following:

- **R syntax**: Understanding the different 'parts of speech' in R; introducing variables and functions, demonstrating how functions work, and modifying arguments for specific use cases.
- **Data structures in R**: Getting a handle on the classes of data structures and the types of data used by R.
- **Data inspection and wrangling**: Reading in data from files. Using indices and various functions to subset and create datasets, including the tidyverse suite of packages.
- **Visualizing data**: Visualizing data using plotting functions from the external package ggplot2.
- **Exporting data and graphics**: Generating new data tables and plots for use outside of the R environment.


In addition to the above, we will focus on good data management practices, installing and working with data wrangling and visualization packages, and the different ways to get help when coding in R. After this workshop participants can expect to be comfortable with the basics of data wrangling and plotting using R.

### **Prerequisites:**

This is one of our basic [workshops](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/), and has **NO prerequisites** and no prior programming experience is required. 

This workshop (or fluency in R) is a prerequisite for advanced workshops introducing the analysis of bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data.

- want to learn how to use R and RStudio for data wrangling and visualizations
- desire to perform data analysis methods where basic knowledge of R is a requirement
- are interested in taking an advanced workshop with us on analysis of sequencing data within the next 6 - 8 months
