# Introducing HBC workshop bundle - Introduction to R AND Introduction to bulk RNA-seq Part II workshop (2023)

*Note: In 2023, some workshops will be taught in person and others will be online via Zoom.*

The Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core Training Team is piloting a *workshop bundle* offering *both* **Introduction to R** and **Introduction to bulkRNA-seq II** workshops since R is a pre-requisite for Introduction to bulkRNA-seq II. This bundled workshop is offered online via Zoom.

### **Description:**
These hands-on workshops will introduce participants to R programming and statistical methods and considerations utilized to perform differential gene expression analysis on bulk RNA-seq data. Participants will learn about best practices in quality control, how to perform statistical analysis to obtain lists of differentially expressed (DE) genes using DESeq2. The workshop will also give participants an overview of tools for functional analysis of DE genes and how to extract some biological meaning from large gene lists.

** Please note that this workshop does NOT cover single-cell RNA-seq analysis. **

** Please note that you **DO NOT** need to attend bulk RNA-seq Part I to attend the Introduction to bukRNA-seq II workshop.

### **Prerequisites:**

This is one of our bundled workshops and has *NO prerequisites* and no prior programming experience is required, however, you'll learn R and it is a pre-requisite for Introduction to bulk RNA-seq Part II. 

Intro to R will fulfill the required prerequisite for other HBC advanced [workshops](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/training_spring2019.html#advanced-topics-analysis-of-high-throughput-sequencing-ngs-data) including Introduction to bulk RNA-seq Part II and Introduction to single cell RNA-seq analysis.

### **Who should attend?**

[Eligible*](#eligibility-requirements) Any researcher affiliated with Harvard University or any Harvard-affiliated institution participating in HIV related research who wants to learn how to: 

- Use R and RStudio for data wrangling and visualizations
- Perform data analysis methods where basic knowledge of R is a requirement
- Perform a differential expression analysis at the gene-level
- Effectively use R to get your data in the appropriate format for DE analysis
- Use the steps and statistical approaches used in assessing the quality of your abundance estimates (count data)
- Visualize expression patterns for differentially expressed genes
- Perform functional analysis on gene lists with R-based tools

### **Cost:**

There is a ***non-refundable*** and ***non-transferable*** $75 registration fee for this workshop bundle.

We will be accepting 25 participants on a first-come, first-served basis:

- **If you are one of the first 25 eligible* registrants**, you will receive an email within 1 week with a link to pay the (non-refundable & non-transferable) $75 registration fee. 
- **If you are not among the first 25 eligible* registrants**, you will be added to the waitlist and notified when we open registration for the next iteration of this workshop.

*NOTE: You will not have a reserved seat for this workshop until you pay the registration fee. Please make sure you pay within the time stated in that email, else you will lose your spot to someone on the waitlist. 

*NOTE2: HBC/CFAR are offering two workshops at 2022 prices. Introduction to R, is being offered at $35 and will increase to $50 for subsequent basic workshops (ie R and Shell). Intro to RNA-seq II is being offered at $50 and subsequent advanced workshops will be offerd at $65. The workshop bundle - both Intro to R and bulk RNA seq II are being offered at a $10 discount to the 2022 rates: $75. Subsequent bundles will be offered at $105.
