*Note: Some HBC workshops are taught in person and others online via Zoom. Please take note for scheduling purposes!*

<!-- ### **IN-PERSON (Longwood Medical Area) Workshop dates and times:**
### **ONLINE (Zoom) Workshop dates and times:** -->

### **Workshop dates and times:**

**TBD**: 9:30 AM - 12 PM

**TBD**: 9:30 AM - 12 PM

NOTE: Workshop dates are subject to change

_Instruction will be **mostly learner-centric**, requiring a time commitment between the workshop sessions!_

### **Description:**
Large-scale data analysis often requires use of high-performance computing (HPC) resources and knowledge of tools available via the command-line interface (also referred to as Unix or Linux or bash or shell).

In this **3-day hands-on workshop** participants will learn the following:

- basic shell commands for navigating the file system, exploring file contents, performing basic operations, such as moving, copying, and renaming
- how to write shell scripts and use "for" loops for efficiently running the same commands on multiple files
- how to use [HMS-RC's](https://it.hms.harvard.edu/our-services/research-computing) O2 cluster for high-performance computing (HPC) - guest logins are provided

**Together, this knowledge is critical for researchers looking to improve efficiency when performing computational tasks and it forms the foundation needed to analyze high-throughput sequencing data.**

---

### **Prerequisites:**

This is one of our basic [workshops](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/), and has **NO prerequisites** and no prior programming experience is required. 

This workshop is a prerequisite for advanced [workshops](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/#advanced-topics) including Investigating Chromatin Biology using ChIP-seq and CUT&RUN, Introduction to Variant Analysis as well as Introduction to bulk RNA-seq: From reads to count matrix.

### **Who should attend?**

Researchers who: 

- want to learn how and why to use the command line interface (Unix/Linux Shell) to efficiently manage and analyze data
- want to use local clusters/high-performance computing environments for analyzing data (e.g. HMS-RC's O2 cluster, or FASRC cluster)
- are interested in taking an advanced workshop with us on analysis of sequencing data within the next 6 - 8 months

### **Cost:**

There is a ***non-refundable*** and ***non-transferable*** registration fee for this workshop*. After registering below, you will receive an email within 1 week with a link to pay.

Priority is given to Harvard Quad and DF/HCC researchers, who are subsidized for this workshop at a price of $50. Others interested in our workshops can find [our prices here](https://hsph.harvard.edu/research/bioinformatics/training/workshop-pricing/) and should register below.

> **NOTE**: _You will not have a reserved seat for this workshop until you pay the registration fee_. Please make sure you pay within the time stated in that email, else you will lose your spot to someone on the waitlist.

> **NOTE*: HMS Graduate Students may receive waivers on registration fees. Please register and we’ll followup with you.
