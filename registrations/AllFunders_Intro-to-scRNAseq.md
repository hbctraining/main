### **Description:**
This **hands-on** workshop will instruct participants on how to design a **single-cell RNA-seq experiment**, and **how to efficiently manage and analyze the data** starting from count matrices. This will be a hands-on workshop in which we will focus on using the Seurat package in R.  

---

### **Prerequisites:**

This is one of our advanced [workshops](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/), and **requires registrants to have attended the following Basic workshop** offered by our training team in the **last 6-8 months**:  

- [Introduction to R](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/registrations/AllFunders_Intro-to-R)

There is an expectation of participants to have some/all of the following programming knowledge:

* Solid understanding of **data structures** and fluent implementation of **basic syntax** in R.
* Ability to use **functions** regularly and can modify arguments when necessary.
* Comfortable **installing packages and troubleshooting** issues.
* **Data wrangling** expertise (subsetting vectors and data frames) using base R or tidyverse
* Familiarity with ggplot2 for **data visualization**.

**I am fluent in R but have not attended the HBC prerequisite workshop, can I still register?**

Yes, please register and provide your R/programming exerience on the form, and we'll get back to you.

<!--
**AND** please do the following:

- Complete the registration first
- Then email us directly at hbctraining@hsph.harvard.edu with a description of your experience/usage of R. -->

### **Who should attend?**

Harvard-affiliated researchers who want to learn: 

- How to design a single-cell RNA-seq experiment
- How to use the Seurat package to analyze single-cell RNA-seq count matrices
- How to compute and assess QC metrics at every step in the workflow
- How to cluster cells based on expression data and derive the identity of the different cell types present
- How to combine samples within a dataset, and across datasets using Integration

---

### **Cost:**

There is a ***non-refundable*** and ***non-transferable*** registration fee for this advanced workshop*. After registering below, you will receive an email within 1 week with a link to pay.

Priority is given to Harvard Quad and DF/HCC researchers, who are subsidized for this workshop at a price of $65. Others interested in our workshops can find [our prices here](https://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu/workshop-pricing) and should register below.
