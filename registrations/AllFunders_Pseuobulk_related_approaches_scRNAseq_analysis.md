### **Description:**
After clustering cells as part of a single-cell RNA-seq experiment, investigators are often interested in carrying out a differential expression analysis between conditions within certain cell types. When the experimental design includes replicates with multi-conditions there is power in identifying differentially expressed genes using a pseudbulk approach.  In this hands-on workshop, we will:

- Discuss various approaches for differential expression using single cell RNA-seq data
- Prepare single-cell RNA-seq raw count data for pseudobulk analysis
- Perform differential expression analysis on pseudobulk counts using DESeq2
- Present approaches for evaluating differential proportions of cells between conditions

---

### **Prerequisites:**

This is one of our advanced [workshops](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/), and **requires registrants to have attended the following Basic workshop** offered by our training team in the **last 6-8 months**:  

- [Introduction to R](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/registrations/AllFunders_Intro-to-R)

There is an expectation of participants to have some/all of the following programming knowledge:

- Solid understanding of **data structures** and fluent implementation of **basic syntax** in R.
- Ability to use **functions** regularly and can modify arguments when necessary.
- Comfortable **installing packages and troubleshooting** issues.
- **Data wrangling** expertise (subsetting vectors and data frames) using base R or tidyverse
- Familiarity with ggplot2 for **data visualization**.
- Familiarity with RStudio interface

_Participants in this workshop would benefit from having some familiarity with single-cell RNA-seq analysis and the use of the [R Seurat package](https://satijalab.org/seurat/), but it is not a requirement._

**I am fluent in R but have not attended the HBC prerequisite workshop, can I still register?**

Yes, please register and provide your R/programming exerience on the form, and we'll get back to you.

### **Who should attend?**

Researchers who want to learn: 

- How to organize scRNA-seq data for DE analysis
- How to use DESeq2 to obtain a list of differentially expressed genes
- How to visualize expression patterns of differentially expressed genes in single cell RNA-seq data

### **Cost:**

There is a ***non-refundable*** and ***non-transferable*** registration fee for this advanced workshop*. After registering below, you will receive an email within 1 week with a link to pay.

Priority is given to Harvard Quad and DF/HCC researchers, who are subsidized for this workshop at a price of $65. Others interested in our workshops can find [our prices here](https://hsph.harvard.edu/research/bioinformatics/training/workshop-pricing/) and should register below.

> **NOTE**: _You will not have a reserved seat for this workshop until you pay the registration fee_. Please make sure you pay within the time stated in that email, else you will lose your spot to someone on the waitlist.

> **NOTE*: HMS Graduate Students may receive waivers on registration fees. Please register and we’ll followup with you.
