### **Description:**
This hands-on workshop will introduce participants to statistical methods and considerations utilized to perform differential gene expression analysis on **bulk RNA-seq** data. Participants will learn about best practices in quality control, how to perform statistical analysis to obtain lists of differentially expressed (DE) genes using DESeq2. The workshop will also give participants an overview of tools for functional analysis of DE genes and how to extract some biological meaning from large gene lists.

### **Prerequisites:**

This is one of our advanced [workshops](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/training_spring2019.html#advanced-topics-analysis-of-high-throughput-sequencing-ngs-data), and **requires registants to have attended the following Basic workshop** offered by our training team in the **last 6-8 months**:  

- [Introduction to R](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/registrations/AllFunders_Intro-to-R)

**I am fluent in R but have not attended the HBC prerequisite workshop, can I still register?**

Yes, you can register **AND** please do the following:

- Complete the registration first
- Then email us directly at hbctraining@hsph.harvard.edu with a description of your knowledge/experience. **Failure to do this step may prevent you from being accepted into this advanced workshop.**

### **Who should attend?**

[Eligible*](#eligibility-requirements) Harvard researchers who have attended our Introduction to R workshop (or have working knowledge of R), and want to learn: 

- How to perform a differential expression analysis at the gene-level on bulk RNA-seq data
- How to effectively use R to get your data in the appropriate format for DE analysis
- The steps and statistical approaches used in assessing the quality of your abundance estimates (count data)
- How to visualize expression patterns for differentially expressed genes
- How to perform functional analysis on gene lists with R-based tools

### **Cost:**

There is a ***non-refundable*** and ***non-transferable*** $65 registration fee for this advanced workshop.

We will be accepting 25 participants on a first-come, first-served basis:

- **If you are one of the first 25 eligible* registrants**, you will receive an email within 1 week with a link to pay the (non-refundable & non-transferable) $65 registration fee.
