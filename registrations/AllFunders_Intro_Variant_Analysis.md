### **Description:**

This Introduction to Variant Analysis workshop is aimed at providing hands-on best practices for calling variants for paired normal/tumor datasets. Importantly, while this workshop focuses on calling variants in the context of paired tumor/normal samples, much of this workshop’s pipeline and discussion is adaptable to other types of variant calling applications. This workshop will demonstrate to participants how to take raw sequence reads and process them into a VCF file with annotated variants. Furthermore, the workshop ends with a tutorial for visualizing called variants within the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) and creating figures using cBioPortal.

### **Prerequisites:**

This is one of our advanced [workshops](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/), and assumes that users have a working knowledg of Shell and HPC or have attended the following Basic workshop offered by our training team in the last 6-8 months:  

- [Shell for Bioinformatics](https://hbctraining.github.io/Shell-for-bioinformatics/) 

There is an expectation of participants to have some/all of the following Shell/HPC knowledge:

- Experience using a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster environment (e.g. O2 at HMS)
- Navigating filesystems (changing directories, listing contents, full/relative paths, wildcards)
- Creating, moving, copying, and removing files/directories
- Searching files and redirection
- Creating ‘for loops' and small scripts
- Creating long, advanced script

I am experienced using Shell/HPC but have not attended the HBC prerequisite workshop, can I still register?

Yes, please register and provide your Shell/HPC exerience on the form, and we'll get back to you.


<!-- OLD:
Yes, you can register **AND** please do the following:

- Complete the registration first
- Then email us directly at hbctraining@hsph.harvard.edu with a **detailed** description of your knowledge/experience in command-line interface and HPC. **Failure to do this step may prevent you from being accepted into this advanced workshop.** -->

### **Who should attend?**

[Eligible*](#eligibility-requirements) Harvard researchers who want to learn: 

- How to design an experiment to call variants
- How to assess QC metrics at every step in the variant calling workflow
- How to call variants within a paired normal/tumor context
- How to visualize results within IGV
- How to interact with cBioPortal and generate figures

### **Cost:**

There is a ***non-refundable*** and ***non-transferable*** $65 registration fee for this advanced workshop*.

We will be accepting 25 participants on a first-come, first-served basis:

- **If you are one of the first 25 eligible* registrants**, you will receive an email within 1 week with a link to pay the (non-refundable & non-transferable) $65 registration fee.
