# Introduction to bulk RNA-seq data Data Analysis Part I workshop (2023) 
**(Experimental design --> Raw data --> Count matrices)**

---

*Note: In 2023, some workshops will be taught in person and others will be online via Zoom.*


### **ONLINE Workshop dates and times:**

**Friday, March 17, 2023**: 9:30 AM - 12 PM

### **Description:**
This hands-on workshop will instruct participants on how to design a bulk RNA-seq experiment, and how to efficiently manage and analyze the data using the command-line interface and high-performance computing. The workshop will cover the first part of the bulk RNA-seq data analysis workflow, from experimental design to the generation of a count matrix. 

Note: Differential gene expression analysis on the count matrix will be covered in a separate workshop (Introduction to bulk RNA-seq data - Part II).

### **Prerequisites:**

This is one of our advanced [workshops](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/training_spring2019.html#advanced-topics-analysis-of-high-throughput-sequencing-ngs-data), and **requires registants to have attended the following Basic workshop** offered by our training team in the **last 6-8 months**:  

- [Introduction to command line interface workshop](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/registrations/AllFunders_Intro_to_Shell)

**I am fluent in command-line but have not attended the HBC prerequisite workshop, can I still register?**

Yes, you can register **AND** please do the following:

- Complete the registration first
- Then email us directly at hbctraining@hsph.harvard.edu with a **detailed** description of your knowledge/experience in command-line interface. **Failure to do this step may prevent you from being accepted into this advanced workshop.**

### **Who should attend?**

[Eligible*](#eligibility-requirements) Harvard researchers who want to learn: 

- How to design a bulk RNA-seq experiment
- The steps involved in taking raw RNA-sequencing data (Illumina) and generating a count (gene expression) matrix
- How to compute and assess QC metrics at every step in the workflow
- How to automate a simple workflow on the cluster using shell scripting
- How to effectively use HMS-RC's O2 cluster for analysis
