### **Description:**
This workshop begins with an introduction to using R and RStudio. Participants will learn the basics of R syntax and how to utlilize functions and packages in R for  data wrangling. Next, we will utilize ggplot2 and other packages within R to create data visualizations, including scatterplots, barplots, boxplots and more. We will assemble the figures into a single, multipanel, publication-grade figure within R. The workshop will conclude with Shiny, where participants will create interactive apps for data exploration. Throughout the workshop, we will emphasize strong practices for data management and reproducibility, while also providing practical exercises for participants to apply the skills they are learning.

### **Who should attend?**

Any interested individuals who are interested in learning to use R to create intuitive, publication-grade figures and interactive apps for data exploration. 

***We encourage academic and industry researchers to apply to this bootcamp.***
