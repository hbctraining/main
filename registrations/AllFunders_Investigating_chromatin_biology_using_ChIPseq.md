### **Description:**

This 3-day hands-on workshop will begin with a basic introduction of concepts related to gene regulation followed by a description of three common approaches used to interrogate chromatin biology: ChIP-seq, CUT&RUN and ATAC-seq. This workshop will provide participants with:

* Important considerations for setting up a successful ChIP-seq/CUT&RUN/ATAC-seq experiment
* A description the detailed workflow for analyzing ChIP-seq data.
* Instruction on how to efficiently manage and analyze high throughput sequencing data starting from sequence reads through to peak calling, using tools and software available on the HMS-RC's high performance compute cluster.

> NOTE: For each step of the workflow there will be additional information describing how parameters might change for CUT&RUN-seq and ATAC-seq.

### **Prerequisites:**

This is one of our advanced [workshops](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/), and **requires registants to have attended the following Basic workshop** offered by our training team in the **last 6-8 months**: (or have a working knowledg of Shell and HPC)  

- [Shell for Bioinformatics](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/registrations/AllFunders_Shell_for_Bioinformatics) 

There is an expectation of participants to be confortable with some/all of the following:

- Experience using a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster environment (e.g. O2 at HMS)
- Navigating filesystems (changing directories, listing contents, full/relative paths, wildcards)
- Creating, moving, copying, and removing files/directories
- Searching files and redirection
- Creating ‘for loops' and small scripts
- Creating long, advanced script

I am experienced using Shell/HPC but have not attended the HBC prerequisite workshop, can I still register?

Yes, please register and provide your Shell/HPC exerience on the form, and we'll get back to you.

### **Who should attend?**

Researchers who want to learn: 

- How to design a good ChIP-seq/CUT&RUN/ATAC-seq experiment
- The analysis workflow starting with raw sequencing data (Illumina) through to identifying significantly enriched regions ("calling peaks")
- How to handle various file formats encountered with ChIP-seq (and related) analysis, using command-line tools such as bedtools and deepTools

### **Cost:**

There is a ***non-refundable*** and ***non-transferable*** registration fee for this advanced workshop*. After registering below, you will receive an email within 1 week with a link to pay.

Priority is given to Harvard Quad and DF/HCC researchers, who are subsidized for this workshop at a price of $65. Others interested in our workshops can find [our prices here](https://hsph.harvard.edu/research/bioinformatics/training/workshop-pricing/) and should register below.

> **NOTE**: _You will not have a reserved seat for this workshop until you pay the registration fee_. Please make sure you pay within the time stated in that email, else you will lose your spot to someone on the waitlist.

> **NOTE*: HMS Graduate Students may receive waivers on registration fees. Please register and we’ll followup with you.
