### **Description:**

This 3-day hands-on workshop will begin with a basic introduction of concepts related to gene regulation followed by a description of three common approaches used to interrogate chromatin biology: ChIP-seq, CUT&RUN and ATAC-seq. This workshop will provide participants with:

* Important considerations for setting up a successful ChIP-seq/CUT&RUN/ATAC-seq experiment
* A description the detailed workflow for analyzing ChIP-seq data.
* Instruction on how to efficiently manage and analyze high throughput sequencing data starting from sequence reads through to peak calling, using tools and software available on the HMS-RC's high performance compute cluster.

> NOTE: For each step of the workflow there will be additional information describing how parameters might change for CUT&RUN-seq and ATAC-seq.

### **Prerequisites:**

This is one of our advanced [workshops](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/), and **requires registants to have attended the following Basic workshop** offered by our training team in the **last 6-8 months**: (or have a working knowledg of Shell and HPC)  

- [Shell for Bioinformatics](https://hbctraining.github.io/Shell-for-bioinformatics/) 

There is an expectation of participants to be confortable with some/all of the following:

- Experience using a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster environment (e.g. O2 at HMS)
- Navigating filesystems (changing directories, listing contents, full/relative paths, wildcards)
- Creating, moving, copying, and removing files/directories
- Searching files and redirection
- Creating â€˜for loops' and small scripts
- Creating long, advanced script

I am experienced using Shell/HPC but have not attended the HBC prerequisite workshop, can I still register?

Yes, please register and provide your Shell/HPC exerience on the form, and we'll get back to you.

<!-- PREVIOUS VERSION: 
**I am fluent in command-line and already use HMS-RC's O2 cluster but have not attended the HBC prerequisite workshop, can I still register?**

Yes, you can register **AND** please do the following:

- Complete the registration first
- Then email us directly at hbctraining@hsph.harvard.edu with a **detailed** description of your experience/usage of thw command-line interface and HPC. -->

### **Who should attend?**

[Eligible*](#eligibility-requirements) Harvard researchers who want to learn: 

- How to design a good ChIP-seq/CUT&RUN/ATAC-seq experiment
- The analysis workflow starting with raw sequencing data (Illumina) through to identifying significantly enriched regions ("calling peaks")
- How to handle various file formats encountered with ChIP-seq (and related) analysis, using command-line tools such as bedtools and deepTools

### **Cost:**

There is a ***non-refundable*** and ***non-transferable*** $65 registration fee for this advanced workshop*.

We will be accepting 25 participants on a first-come, first-served basis:

- **If you are one of the first 25 eligible* registrants**, you will receive an email within 1 week with a link to pay the (non-refundable & non-transferable) $65 registration fee. 
- **If you are not among the first 25 eligible* registrants**, you will be added to the waitlist and notified when we open registration for the next iteration of this workshop.

*NOTE: You will not have a reserved seat for this workshop until you pay the registration fee. Please make sure you pay within the time stated in that email, else you will lose your spot to someone on the waitlist.*

*NOTE: HMS Graduate Students may receive waivers on registration fees. Please register and we'll followup with you.
