### **Description:**
This hands-on workshop will instruct participants on how to design a bulk RNA-seq experiment, and how to efficiently manage and analyze the data using the command-line interface and high-performance computing. The workshop will cover the first part of the bulk RNA-seq data analysis workflow, from experimental design to the generation of a count matrix. 

Note: Differential gene expression analysis on the count matrix will be covered in a separate workshop (Introduction to bulk RNA-seq data - Part II).

### **Prerequisites:**

This is one of our advanced [workshops](https://github.com/hbctraining/main/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#how-can-i-apply-the-basic-skills), and assumes that users have a working knowledge of Shell and HPC or have attended the following Basic workshop offered by our training team in the last 6-8 months:  

- [Shell for Bioinformatics](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/registrations/AllFunders_Shell_for_Bioinformatics) 

There is an expectation of participants to have some/all of the following Shell/HPC knowledge:

- Experience using a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster environment (e.g. O2 at HMS)
- Navigating filesystems (changing directories, listing contents, full/relative paths, wildcards)
- Creating, moving, copying, and removing files/directories
- Searching files and redirection
- Creating ‘for loops' and small scripts
- Creating long, advanced script

I am experienced using Shell/HPC but have not attended the HBC prerequisite workshop, can I still register?

Yes, please register and provide your Shell/HPC exerience on the form, and we'll get back to you.
