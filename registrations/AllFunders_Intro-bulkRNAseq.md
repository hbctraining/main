# Introduction to bulk RNA-seq: From reads to count matrix

---

*Note: Some HBC workshops are taught in person and others online via Zoom. Please take note for scheduling purposes!*

<!-- ### **IN-PERSON (Longwood Medical Area) Workshop dates and times:**
### **ONLINE (Zoom) Workshop dates and times:** -->

**TBD**: 9:30 AM - 12 PM

**TBD**: 9:30 AM - 12 PM

**TBD**: 9:30 AM - 12 PM

NOTE: Workshop dates are subject to change

_Instruction will be mostly learner-centric, requiring a time commitment between the workshop sessions!_

### **Description:**
This hands-on workshop will instruct participants on how to design a bulk RNA-seq experiment, and how to efficiently manage and analyze the data using the command-line interface and high-performance computing. The workshop will cover the first part of the bulk RNA-seq data analysis workflow, from experimental design to the generation of a count matrix. 

Note: Differential gene expression analysis on the count matrix will be covered in a separate workshop (Introduction to bulk RNA-seq data - Part II).

### **Prerequisites:**

This is one of our advanced [workshops](https://github.com/hbctraining/main/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#how-can-i-apply-the-basic-skills), and assumes that users have a working knowledge of Shell and HPC or have attended the following Basic workshop offered by our training team in the last 6-8 months:  

- [Shell for Bioinformatics](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/registrations/AllFunders_Shell_for_Bioinformatics) 

There is an expectation of participants to have some/all of the following Shell/HPC knowledge:

- Experience using a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster environment (e.g. O2 at HMS)
- Navigating filesystems (changing directories, listing contents, full/relative paths, wildcards)
- Creating, moving, copying, and removing files/directories
- Searching files and redirection
- Creating ‘for loops' and small scripts
- Creating long, advanced script

I am experienced using Shell/HPC but have not attended the HBC prerequisite workshop, can I still register?

Yes, please register and provide your Shell/HPC exerience on the form, and we'll get back to you.

### **Who should attend?**

Harvard-affiliated researchers who want to learn:
- How to design a bulk RNA-seq experiment
- The steps involved in taking raw RNA-sequencing data (Illumina) and generating a count (gene expression) matrix
- How to compute and assess QC metrics at every step in the workflow
- How to automate a simple workflow on the cluster using shell scripting
- How to effectively use HMS-RC's O2 cluster for analysis

### **Cost:**

There is a ***non-refundable*** and ***non-transferable*** registration fee for this advanced workshop*. After registering below, you will receive an email within 1 week with a link to pay.

Priority is given to Harvard Quad and DF/HCC researchers, who are subsidized for this workshop at a price of $65. Others interested in our workshops can find [our prices here](hhttps://hsph.harvard.edu/research/bioinformatics/training/workshop-pricing/) and should register below.

> **NOTE**: _You will not have a reserved seat for this workshop until you pay the registration fee_. Please make sure you pay within the time stated in that email, else you will lose your spot to someone on the waitlist.

> **NOTE*: HMS Graduate Students may receive waivers on registration fees. Please register and we’ll followup with you.
