# Introduction to R workshop (2022)

*Note: Until further notice, workshops will be taught online via Zoom. However, we anticipate returning to in-person teaching in 2022.*


### **Workshop dates and times:**

**Tuesday, October 11th**: 9:30 AM - 12 PM

**Friday, October 14th**: 9:30 AM - 12 PM

**Tuesday, October 18th**: 9:30 AM - 12 PM

_Instruction will be **mostly learner-centric**, requiring a time commitment between the workshop sessions!_

### **Description:**
Access to tools and computational resources for large-scale data analysis often require knowledge of the command-line interface (also referred to as Unix or Linux or bash or shell). In this 3-day hands-on workshop participants will learn the following:

- basic shell commands for navigating the file system, exploring file contents, performing basic operations, such as moving, copying, and renaming
- how to write shell scripts and use "for" loops for efficiently running the same commands on multiple files
- how to use [HMS-RC's](https://it.hms.harvard.edu/our-services/research-computing) O2 cluster for high-performance computing (HPC)

**Together, this knowledge is critical for researchers looking to improve efficiency when performing computational tasks and it forms the foundation needed to analyze high-throughput sequencing data.**

---

### **Prerequisites:**

This is one of our basic [workshops](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/), and has **NO prerequisites** and no prior programming experience is required. 

This workshop is a prerequisite for advanced workshops introducing the analysis of RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and Introduction to Chromatin biology.

---

### Course requirements:**

- Mandatory attendance for all three classes
- 2-3 hours of reading and exercises from selected lessons before each workshop session
- Active paricipation during discussion sessions

Instruction will be mostly learner-centric. Online classes will be focused on exercises and discussion. Please make sure you take this into account when you sign up for the workshop!

### **Who should attend?**

[Eligible*](#eligibility-requirements) Harvard researchers who: 

- want to learn how and why to use the command line interface (Unix/Linux Shell) to efficiently manage and analyze data
- want to use local clusters/high-performance computing environments for analyzing data (e.g. HMS-RC's O2 cluster, or FASRC cluster)
- are interested in taking an advanced workshop with us on analysis of sequencing data within the next 6 - 8 months


---

### **Cost:**

There is a ***non-refundable*** and ***non-transferable*** $35 registration fee for this workshop.

We will be accepting 25 participants on a first-come, first-served basis:

- **If you are one of the first 25 eligible* registrants**, you will receive an email within 1 week with a link to pay the (non-refundable & non-transferable) $35 registration fee. 
- **If you are not among the first 25 eligible* registrants**, you will be added to the waitlist and notified when we open registration for the next iteration of this workshop.

*NOTE: You will not have a reserved seat for this workshop until you pay the registration fee. Please make sure you pay within the time stated in that email, else you will lose your spot to someone on the waitlist.*

### **Registration:**

Please make sure you **take the following into account when signing up** for the workshop:
 
1. _Participants are expected to **attend all four sessions**._
2. _Between workshop sessions **participants will be required to spend 2-3 hours on reading and exercises**._
3. _**Online (Zoom) and in-person** classes will be focused on exercises and **discussion**._
