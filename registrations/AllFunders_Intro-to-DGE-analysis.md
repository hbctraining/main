# Introduction to Differential Gene Expression Analysis

*Note: Some HBC workshops are taught in person and others are online via Zoom. Please take note for scheduling purposes!*

<!-- ### **IN-PERSON (Longwood Medical Area) Workshop dates and times:**
### **ONLINE (Zoom) Workshop dates and times:** -->

**TBD**: 10 AM - 12 PM

**TBD**: 10 AM - 12 PM

NOTE: Workshop dates are subject to change.

_Instruction will be mostly learner-centric, requiring a time commitment between the workshop sessions!_

### **Description:**
This hands-on workshop will introduce participants to statistical methods and considerations utilized to perform differential gene expression analysis on **bulk RNA-seq** data. Participants will learn about best practices in quality control, how to perform statistical analysis to obtain lists of differentially expressed (DE) genes using DESeq2. The workshop will also give participants an overview of tools for functional analysis of DE genes and how to extract some biological meaning from large gene lists.

### **Prerequisites:**

This is one of our advanced workshops, and requires registrants to have attended the following Basic workshop offered by our training team in the last 12-24 months:

- [Introduction to R](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/registrations/AllFunders_Intro-to-R)
  
There is an expectation of participants to have some/all of the following programming knowledge:

- Solid understanding of **data structures** and fluent implementation of **basic syntax** in R.
- Ability to use **functions** regularly and can modify arguments when necessary.
- Comfortable **installing packages and troubleshooting** issues.
- **Data wrangling** expertise (subsetting vectors and data frames) using base R or tidyverse
- Familiarity with ggplot2 for **data visualization**.
  
**I am fluent in R but have not attended the HBC prerequisite workshop, can I still register?**

Yes, please register and **provide your R/programming exerience on the form**, and we'll get back to you.

### **Who should attend?**

Harvard-affiliated researchers who have attended our Introduction to R workshop (or have working knowledge of R), and want to learn: 

- How to perform a differential expression analysis at the gene-level on bulk RNA-seq data
- How to effectively use R to get your data in the appropriate format for DE analysis
- The steps and statistical approaches used in assessing the quality of your abundance estimates (count data)
- How to visualize expression patterns for differentially expressed genes
- How to perform functional analysis on gene lists with R-based tools

### **Cost:**

There is a ***non-refundable*** and ***non-transferable*** registration fee for this advanced workshop*. After registering below, you will receive an email within 1 week with a link to pay.

Priority is given to Harvard Quad and DF/HCC researchers, who are subsidized for this workshop at a price of $65. Others interested in our workshops can find [our prices here](https://hsph.harvard.edu/research/bioinformatics/training/workshop-pricing/) and should register below.

> **NOTE**: _You will not have a reserved seat for this workshop until you pay the registration fee_. Please make sure you pay within the time stated in that email, else you will lose your spot to someone on the waitlist.

> **NOTE*: HMS Graduate Students may receive waivers on registration fees. Please register and we’ll followup with you.
