# Introducing HBC workshop bundle - Introduction to R AND Introduction to Differential Gene Expression Analysis workshop

The Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core Training Team is piloting a *workshop bundle* offering *both* **Introduction to R** and **Introduction to Differential Gene Expression Analysis** workshops since R is a pre-requisite for the Introduction to Differential Gene Expression Analysis. 

### **Workshop bundle**

<!-- ### **IN-PERSON (Longwood Medical Area) Workshop dates and times:**

### **Description:**
These hands-on workshops will introduce participants to R programming and statistical methods and considerations utilized to perform differential gene expression analysis on bulk RNA-seq data. Participants will learn about best practices in quality control, how to perform statistical analysis to obtain lists of differentially expressed (DE) genes using DESeq2. The workshop will also give participants an overview of tools for functional analysis of DE genes and how to extract some biological meaning from large gene lists.

** Please note that this workshop does NOT cover single-cell RNA-seq analysis. **

** Please note that you DO NOT need to attend Part I to attend this workshop.

### **Prerequisites:**

This is one of our bundled workshops and has NO prerequisites and no prior programming experience is required, however, R is a pre-requisite for Introduction to Differential Gene Expression Analysis.

Introduction to R will fulfill the required prerequisite for other HBC advanced [workshops](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/table_of_training_README.html#advanced-topics) including Introduction to single cell RNA-seq analysis and Introduction to Differential Gene Expression Analysis.

### **Who should attend?**

[Eligible*](#eligibility-requirements) Harvard researchers who want to learn how to: 

- Use R and RStudio for data wrangling and visualizations
- Perform data analysis methods where basic knowledge of R is a requirement
- Perform a differential expression analysis at the gene-level
- Effectively use R to get your data in the appropriate format for DE analysis
- Use the steps and statistical approaches used in assessing the quality of your abundance estimates (count data)
- Visualize expression patterns for differentially expressed genes
- Perform functional analysis on gene lists with R-based tools

### **Cost:**

There is a ***non-refundable*** and ***non-transferable*** $105 registration fee for this workshop bundle.

We will be accepting 25 participants on a first-come, first-served basis:

- **If you are one of the first 25 eligible* registrants**, you will receive an email within 1 week with a link to pay the (non-refundable & non-transferable) $105 registration fee.
