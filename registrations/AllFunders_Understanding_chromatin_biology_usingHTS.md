### **Description:**

This 3-day hands-on workshop will begin with a basic introduction of concepts related to gene regulation followed by a description of three common approaches used to interrogate chromatin biology: ChIP-seq, CUT&RUN and ATAC-seq. This workshop will provide participants with important considerations for setting up a successful ChIP-seq/CUT&RUN/ATAC-seq experiment and describe the detailed workflow for analyzing ChIP-seq data. For each step of the workflow there will be additional information describing how parameters might change for CUT&RUN-seq and ATAC-seq.  The workshop will instruct participants on how to efficiently manage and analyze high throughput sequencing data starting from sequence reads through to peak calling, using tools and software available on the HMS-RC's high performance compute cluster.

### **Prerequisites:**

This is one of our advanced [workshops](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/training_spring2019.html#advanced-topics-analysis-of-high-throughput-sequencing-ngs-data), and **requires registants to have attended the following Basic workshop** offered by our training team in the **last 6-8 months**:  

- [Introduction to command-line interface workshop ](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/registrations/AllFunders_Intro_to_Shell)

**I am fluent in command-line and already use HMS-RC's O2 cluster but have not attended the HBC prerequisite workshop, can I still register?**

Yes, you can register **AND** please do the following:

- Complete the registration first
- Then email us directly at hbctraining@hsph.harvard.edu with a **detailed** description of your knowledge/experience in command-line interface and HPC. **Failure to do this step may prevent you from being accepted into this advanced workshop.**

### **Who should attend?**

[Eligible*](#eligibility-requirements) Harvard researchers who want to learn: 

- How to design a good ChIP-seq/CUT&RUN/ATAC-seq experiment
- The analysis workflow starting with raw sequencing data (Illumina) through to identifying significantly enriched regions ("calling peaks")
- How to handle various file formats encountered with ChIP-seq (and related) analysis, using command-line tools such as bedtools and deepTools

### **Cost:**

There is a ***non-refundable*** and ***non-transferable*** $65 registration fee for this advanced workshop*.

We will be accepting 25 participants on a first-come, first-served basis:

- **If you are one of the first 25 eligible* registrants**, you will receive an email within 1 week with a link to pay the (non-refundable & non-transferable) $65 registration fee. 
- **If you are not among the first 25 eligible* registrants**, you will be added to the waitlist and notified when we open registration for the next iteration of this workshop.

*NOTE: You will not have a reserved seat for this workshop until you pay the registration fee. Please make sure you pay within the time stated in that email, else you will lose your spot to someone on the waitlist.*

*NOTE: HMS Graduate Students may receive waivers on registration fees. Please register and we'll followup with you.
