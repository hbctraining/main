### **Description:**
Large-scale data analysis often requires use of high-performance computing (HPC) resources and knowledge of tools available via the command-line interface (also referred to as Unix or Linux or bash or shell).

In this **3-day hands-on workshop** participants will learn the following:

- basic shell commands for navigating the file system, exploring file contents, performing basic operations, such as moving, copying, and renaming
- how to write shell scripts and use "for" loops for efficiently running the same commands on multiple files
- how to use [HMS-RC's](https://it.hms.harvard.edu/our-services/research-computing) O2 cluster for high-performance computing (HPC) - guest logins are provided

**Together, this knowledge is critical for researchers looking to improve efficiency when performing computational tasks and it forms the foundation needed to analyze high-throughput sequencing data.**

---

### **Prerequisites:**

This is one of our basic [workshops](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/), and has **NO prerequisites** and no prior programming experience is required. 

This workshop is a prerequisite for advanced [workshops](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/#advanced-topics) including the upcoming Variant Calling workshop as well as Introduction to bulk RNA-seq I and Understanding Chromatin biology (ChIP-seq/ATAC-seq).

### **Who should attend?**

[Eligible*](#eligibility-requirements) Harvard researchers who: 

- want to learn how and why to use the command line interface (Unix/Linux Shell) to efficiently manage and analyze data
- want to use local clusters/high-performance computing environments for analyzing data (e.g. HMS-RC's O2 cluster, or FASRC cluster)
- are interested in taking an advanced workshop with us on analysis of sequencing data within the next 6 - 8 months

### **Cost:**

There is a ***non-refundable*** and ***non-transferable*** $50 registration fee for this workshop.

We will be accepting 25 participants on a first-come, first-served basis:

- **If you are one of the first 25 eligible* registrants**, you will receive an email within 1 week with a link to pay the (non-refundable & non-transferable) $50 registration fee. 
- **If you are not among the first 25 eligible* registrants**, you will be added to the waitlist and notified when we open registration for the next iteration of this workshop.

*NOTE: You will not have a reserved seat for this workshop until you pay the registration fee. Please make sure you pay within the time stated in that email, else you will lose your spot to someone on the waitlist.*

*NOTE: HMS Graduate Students may receive waivers on registration fees. Please register and weâ€™ll followup with you.
