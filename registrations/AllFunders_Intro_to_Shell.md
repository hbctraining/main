# Introduction to the Command-Line Interface (Shell, Bash, Unix, Linux) (2023)

*Note: In 2023, some HBC workshops will be taught in person and others will be online via Zoom.*


### **ONLINE Workshop dates and times:**

**Tuesday, October 24th 2023**: 9:30 AM - 12 PM

**Friday, October 27th 2023**: 9:30 AM - 12 PM

**Tuesday, October 31st 2023**: 9:30 AM - 12 PM

_Instruction will be **mostly learner-centric**, requiring a time commitment between the workshop sessions!_

### **Description:**
Access to tools and computational resources for large-scale data analysis often require knowledge of the command-line interface (also referred to as Unix or Linux or bash or shell). In this **3-day hands-on workshop** participants will learn the following:

- basic shell commands for navigating the file system, exploring file contents, performing basic operations, such as moving, copying, and renaming
- how to write shell scripts and use "for" loops for efficiently running the same commands on multiple files
- how to use [HMS-RC's](https://it.hms.harvard.edu/our-services/research-computing) O2 cluster for high-performance computing (HPC)

**Together, this knowledge is critical for researchers looking to improve efficiency when performing computational tasks and it forms the foundation needed to analyze high-throughput sequencing data.**

---

### **Prerequisites:**

This is one of our basic [workshops](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/), and has **NO prerequisites** and no prior programming experience is required. 

This workshop is a prerequisite for advanced [workshops](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/#advanced-topics) introducing the analysis of RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and Introduction to Chromatin biology.

### **Who should attend?**

[Eligible*](#eligibility-requirements) Harvard researchers who: 

- want to learn how and why to use the command line interface (Unix/Linux Shell) to efficiently manage and analyze data
- want to use local clusters/high-performance computing environments for analyzing data (e.g. HMS-RC's O2 cluster, or FASRC cluster)
- are interested in taking an advanced workshop with us on analysis of sequencing data within the next 6 - 8 months

### **Cost:**

There is a ***non-refundable*** and ***non-transferable*** $50 registration fee for this workshop.

We will be accepting 25 participants on a first-come, first-served basis:
