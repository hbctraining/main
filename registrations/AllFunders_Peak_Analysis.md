### **Description:**
This multi-day hands-on workshop will provide students with a suite of tools and a basic workflow of how to handle data generated from peak calling algorithms. Specifically, the workshop will focus on taking BED file formats (i.e. narrowPeak) and identifying what these regions represent. This workshop will introduce participants to:
- Approaches to check peak quality and reproducibility across replicates
- Peak annotation methods and tools for visualization
- Differential peak enrichment analysis and functional analysis

---

### **Prerequisites:**

This is one of our advanced [workshops](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/#how-can-i-apply-the-basic-skills), and **requires registrants to have attended the following Basic workshop** offered by our training team in the **last 6-8 months**:  

- [Introduction to R](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/registrations/AllFunders_Intro-to-R)

There is an expectation of participants to have some/all of the following programming knowledge:

* Solid understanding of **data structures** and fluent implementation of **basic syntax** in R.
* Ability to use **functions** regularly and can modify arguments when necessary.
* Comfortable **installing packages and troubleshooting** issues.
* **Data wrangling** expertise (subsetting vectors and data frames) using base R or tidyverse
* Familiarity with ggplot2 for **data visualization**.

**I am fluent in R but have not attended the HBC prerequisite workshop, can I still register?**

Yes, please register and provide your R/programming exerience on the form, and we'll get back to you.

<!--
**AND** please do the following:

- Complete the registration first
- Then email us directly at hbctraining@hsph.harvard.edu with a description of your experience/usage of R. -->

### **Who should attend?**

Researchers who want to learn: 

- How to check their peak data for quality
- How to annotate peaks with genomic features of interest
- How to visualize peaks and their relationships to genomic features
- How to perform differential peak enrichment analysis
- How to perform functional analysis (such as over-representation analysis)

---

### **Cost:**

There is a ***non-refundable*** and ***non-transferable*** registration fee for this advanced workshop*. After registering below, you will receive an email within 1 week with a link to pay.

Priority is given to Harvard Quad and DF/HCC researchers, who are subsidized for this workshop at a price of $65. Others interested in our workshops can find [our prices here](https://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu/workshop-pricing) and should register below.
