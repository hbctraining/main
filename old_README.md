# Training program description:

The training team at the Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core provides bioinformatics training in multiple formats, they can be broadly divided into the following: 

1. [Introduction to Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis series](#introduction-to-next-generation-sequencing-ngs-analysis-series)
2. [Current topics in bioinformatics series](#current-topics-in-bioinformatics-series)

Our current workshops and courses are designed to help biologists become comfortable with using tools to analyse high-throughput data. We are slowly beginning to expand this repertoire to include training for researchers with more advanced bioinformatics skills. 

See our current workshop schedule on our [training website](http://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu/training#for-hsci-and-on-quad-hms-researchers).

## Introduction to Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis series:

This series of workshops is divided into 2 categories, [Basic Data Skills](#basic-data-skills) and [Advanced Topics](#advanced-topics). The Basic workshops serve as the foundation that participants can build upon in the Advanced workshops and we will be offering these as pairs with the appropriate basic workshop preceding and advanced one. Please see below for a description of workshops under each of these 2 categories.

### Basic Data Skills:

These workshops provide an introduction to computational skills required for someone to get started with analyzing high-throughput sequencing data independently. These have no prerequisites and do not require any prior experience with programming.

| Topic and Link(s) to lessons | Prerequisites |
| :----: | :----: | 
| [Introduction to the command-line interface (shell) - O2 cluster](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-shell-flipped/schedule/links-to-lessons.html) | None |
| [Introduction to the command-line interface (shell) - FAS-RC cluster](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-shell-fasrc-flipped/schedule/links-to-lessons.html) | None |
| [Introduction to R](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R-flipped/schedules/links-to-lessons.html) | None |
| [Introduction to R (video tutorials)](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/hcatrresource/) | None |
  
### Advanced Topics:

These are intensive workshops that instruct participants on how to design experiments, and efficiently manage & analyze data. They focus on the workflow for a specific type of next-generation sequencing application (i.e RNA-seq, ChIP-seq). *These workshops require participants to have taken one or more of the [Basic Data Skills workshops](#basic-data-skills) as listed in the table below.*
