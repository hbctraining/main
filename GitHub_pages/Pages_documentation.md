# Inspecting the GitHub page

You should now be able to navigate to *https://<your_github_user_or_group>.github.io/<your_repo_name>/*. In this case, we will navigate to https://hbctraining.github.io/github_pages_demo/. At this point this page should look like:

<img src="img/GItHub_Pages_unformatted_with_tag.png" width="600">
</p>

> Note: If you go to https://hbctraining.github.io/github_pages_demo/ it will show after later formatting has been added.
