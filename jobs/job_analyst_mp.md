* At least 2 years experience performing HTS analyses as the lead analyst
* Teaching experience (courses or workshops)
* Excellent written and spoken English
* Programming and data skills
  * Knowledge of shell and high-performance computing
  * Knowledge of R or Python
* Experience in at least one of the following HTS domains:
  * Whole genome sequencing
  * Exome-seq
  * RNA-seq (bulk/single-cell)
  * ChIP-seq or ATAC-seq
  * Other sequencing applications
* Proven ability to interpret and analyze large data sets and present results
* Strong interpersonal skills

### Preferred Qualifications
* Post-doctoral experience
* Experience training researchers to perform HTS data analysis
* Biostatistics expertise
* Cancer research experience
* Experience applying HTS to Cancer research
* Interest in development of bioinformatics pipelines
* Experience interacting with clients and/or collaborators

*Position is flexible, and can be tailored to a more **senior role** for applicants with appropriate expertise.*
