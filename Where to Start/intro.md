## This is for people who are feeling overwhelmed and lost


* Are the words 'omics, HTS, R programming, shell, and computer cluster new for you?
* Are you unsure how to start getting comfortable with large data sets?
* Have you never written a single line of code?


### If this fits you then you are on the right page! 

Let's start by trying to understand what 'omics data, HTS, computer clusters, shell, and R are and who might need to use them.


## What the heck is 'omics?

New sequencing technologies (often abbreviated **NGS for next generation sequencing**) now allow us to look at the entirety of a certain type of data in an organsim. To put it another way, scientists used to be limited to studying one gene, one protein etc. 'omics data encompasses the entirety genes, proteins, etc in a cell or organism. We can break 'omics down into specific categories

* genOMICS - The study of the complete set of **DNA** in an organism, sigle cells, or group of cells
* transcriptOMICS - The study of the complete set of **RNA** in an organism, sigle cells, or group of cells
* proteOMICS - The study of the complete set of **Proteins** in an organism, sigle cells, or group of cells
* metabolOMICS - The study of the complete set of **Metabolites** in an organism, sigle cells, or group of cells


## How does High Throughput Sequencing relate to 'omics?

High Throughput Sequencing (HTS)
