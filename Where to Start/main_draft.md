We are delighted to have you here!

The training team at the Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core provides bioinformatics to help biologists become comfortable with using tools to analyse high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data. 


We offer courses and skills at three different levels starting at the basics and building upwards. We focus on the two most commonly used HTS interfaces, **R** and **Bash/Shell**.
