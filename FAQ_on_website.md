- Where can I find the workshop schedule?

You could find our workshop schedule for HSCI, HMS, DF/HCC researchers [here](https://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu/upcoming-workshops), and short 3-hour workshops for all Harvard affiliates [here](https://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu/current-bioinformatics-topics-workshops)

- When does the registration of a workshop open?

The workshop registration usually opens three weeks prior to the workshop date. We accept participants on a first-come, first-served basis, so register early when you see the workshop opens up.

- What if I am not sure whether my lab meets the eligibility requirement?

Please register for the workshop anywway, and we will get back to you.

- What if I am eligible, but the workshop is full when I register?

We will place you on the waiting list, and if no more slots open up this time, you will receive advanced registration through email for the next iteration of the same workshop.

- I am not affiliated with Harvard. Could I join the workshop?

Unfortunately, our workshops are only open to Harvard affiliates at the moment. However, you are welcome to use our [training materials](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/) for self-paced learning.

- I have not attended the basic workshop. Could I directly join the advanced workshop if I have the necessary technical background?

We make the decision on a case-by-case basis. We require you email us with your relevant experience (please refer to the corresponding workshop registration page for more detail), and we will get back to you if you could skip the basic workshop.

- Do I need to attend all sessions of a workshop?

Yes, attendance to all sessions are expected. If you need to be absent for a small chunk of time, please email us ahead of time. If there are any days that you could not join due to the conflict of your schedule, we suggest you wait for the next iteration of the workshop.

- Do you record the workshop on Zoom?

No, we do not record our workshops.

- Do you offer any video tutorials for your training material?

In collaboration with Harvard Catalyst, we developed an online, hands-on video tutorial for "Introduction to R". You could access the resource [here](https://catalyst.harvard.edu/courses/intro-to-r/) (HarvardKey login required).

- Can I sign up for a mailing list?

Yes! You could sign up our [mailing list](https://hsphsun3.harvard.edu/mailman/listinfo/hbctraining), to receive update on future workshops.
