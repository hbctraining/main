### Where can I find the workshop schedule?

You could find our workshop schedule for HMS, DF/HCC researchers [here](https://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu/upcoming-workshops), and short 3-hour workshops available for all Harvard affiliates [here](https://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu/current-bioinformatics-topics-workshops)

### When does the registration for a workshop open?

The workshop registration usually opens three weeks prior to the workshop date. We accept participants on a first-come, first-served basis, so register early!

### Can I get an email when registration opens?

Yes! You should sign up for our [mailing list](https://hsphsun3.harvard.edu/mailman/listinfo/hbctraining) to receive timely emails about upcoming workshops.

### Who is eligible for workshops sponsored by DF/HCC and HMS?

**DF/HCC:** Researchers in the lab of any [DF/HCC member](https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/insider/for-researchers/) is eligible.

**HMS:** To be eligible through HMS, PIs have to be in one of the “[Basic and Social Science](https://hms.harvard.edu/departments?f%5B0%5D=department_type%3A231)” departments at HMS, or have a grant administered through HMS (Gordon Hall) directly.

### What if I am not sure whether my lab meets the eligibility requirement?

Please register for the workshop anywway, and we will get back to you.

### What if I am eligible, but the workshop is full when I register?

We will place you on the waiting list, and if no more slots open up this time you will receive priority for the next iteration of the same workshop. You will not have to re-register, we will send you an email with information about the workshop and a mechanism to pay the registration fee.

### I am not affiliated with Harvard. Can I join your workshops?

Unfortunately, our workshops are only open to Harvard affiliates at the moment. However, you are welcome to use our [training materials linked on this page](https://hbctraining.github.io/main/) for self-paced learning.

### I have not attended the basic workshop, can I directly join the advanced workshop if I have the necessary technical background?

We make the decision on a case-by-case basis and we encourage you to do the following:
1. register for the advanced workshop first
1. [email us](mailto: hbctraining@hsph.harvard.edu) with your experience (please refer to the corresponding workshop registration page for more details about the pre-requisites)

Once we assess your registration+email we will let you know.

### Do I need to attend all sessions of a workshop?

**Yes**, attendance to all sessions is mandatory and expected. If you need to be absent for a small chunk of time, please email us ahead of time. If there are any days that you cannot join due scheduling conflicts, we suggest you wait for the next iteration of the workshop.

### Do you record the workshop on Zoom?

No, we do not record our workshops, and we **do not give permission** for others to record it.

### Do you offer any video tutorials for your training material?

In collaboration with Harvard Catalyst, we developed an online, hands-on video tutorial for "Introduction to R". You could access the resource [here](https://catalyst.harvard.edu/courses/intro-to-r/) (Harvard Key login required).
