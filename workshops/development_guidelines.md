## General guidelines
(copied over from https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OhrFpQhBt4qb4R4LIm54VCc8cb_FZB3EWFcOO42giNU/edit)

* Workflow development
  * **Initial Meeting** to discuss overall workshop objectives, flow/narrative and set deadlines
  * Develop lesson **Draft 0** (complete at least 6 weeks before workshop)
    * Worked on by developer (not necessarily the person teaching)
    * Mostly code with light explanations as necessary (depends on developer)
    * No figures needed
    * Code should be tested in a clean environment by developer (if possible)
  * Develop lesson **Draft 1** (complete at least 3 weeks before workshop)
    * Developer creates placeholder markdowns for each individual lesson
       * Each lesson should have header and learning obectives
       * Include a section outlining in bullet points what code and content will be in this lesson. Be as speicfic as possible about your vision)
       * Add sub-headers for sections you want to exist in the lesson
       * Place the code and bare bones text in each lesson
       * Assign it to an instructor to develop (set deadlines)
           
> #### Completed Draft 1 checklist (for each person assigned to a lesson)
> * Expanded explanations and narrative with good flow
> * Figures added with citations, if required
> * URLs to resources/papers added
> * All code will have been tested by one other person
> * Creation of a text/script file with all the code (maybe)

* Development of **Final Draft**
  * Developer reviews all Draft 1 lessons
    * Check for flow of the narrative 
    * All figures should be centered and formatted (appropriate sizing)
    * Include additional figures if it is too text-heavy
    * Make sure all hyperlinks work
    * For advanced workshops, each lesson/step of workflow needs a workflow schematic at the top (under learning objectives)
    * Each lesson should have CCBY attribution listed at the bottom (see existing lessons)
* Create a schedule page and link all lessons
   * Include self-learning sections and pull-downs
   * Add answer keys section
