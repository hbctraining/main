## Guidelines to develop materials
(copied over from https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OhrFpQhBt4qb4R4LIm54VCc8cb_FZB3EWFcOO42giNU/edit)

### Workshops
* Better deadlines that are met!
* Better coordination between developers
* Workflow development
  * Meeting to overall workshop discuss flow/narrative and set deadline
  * Develop lesson Draft 0 (complete at least 6 weeks before workshop)
    * Worked on by developer (not necessarily the person teaching)
    * Mostly code with explanations as necessary (depends on developer)
    * No figures needed
    * Code should be tested in a clean environment by developer (if possible)
  * Develop lesson Draft 1 (complete at least 3 weeks before workshop)
    * Others will work with developer on lessons they are potentially teaching to create Draft 1 from Draft 0 (which was presumably created by developer)
    * Draft 1 definition
      * Expanded explanations
      * Figures added
      * URLs to resources/papers added
      * Code will have been tested by one other person
      * Creation of a single md or R file with all the code (maybe)
  * Review of full workflow (all lessons) by at least 2 people (complete at least 2 weeks before workshop)
    * One person should test on teaching computer
    * If feasible, test on PC
