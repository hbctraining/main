## General guidelines
(copied over from https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OhrFpQhBt4qb4R4LIm54VCc8cb_FZB3EWFcOO42giNU/edit)

Below we have outlined the recommended workflow for developing a workshop. This typically applies to the main workshops (Basic and Advanced) and less relevant for training modules (short 3 hour workshops). The **process will begin with an Initial Meeting** to discuss overall workshop objectives, flow/narrative and set deadlines. Next we discuss the expectation for each draft/iteration of development.

### Draft 0
Develop lesson **Draft 0** (complete at least 6 weeks before workshop)

* Worked on by developer (not necessarily the person teaching)
* Mostly code with light explanations as necessary (depends on developer)
* No figures needed
* Code should be tested in a clean environment by developer (if possible)

### Draft 1
Develop lesson **Draft 1** (complete at least 3 weeks before workshop)
    
* Developer creates placeholder markdowns for each individual lesson
   * Each lesson should have header and learning obectives
   * Include a section outlining in bullet points what code and content will be in this lesson. Be as speicfic as possible about your vision)
   * Add sub-headers for sections you want to exist in the lesson
   * Place the code and bare bones text in each lesson
   * Assign it to an instructor to develop (set deadlines)
           
> #### Completed Draft 1 checklist (for each person assigned to a lesson)
> * Expanded explanations and narrative with good flow
> * Figures added with citations, if required
> * URLs to resources/papers added
> * All code will have been tested by one other person
> * Creation of a text/script file with all the code (maybe)

### Final Draft
Development of **Final Draft**. The following is desribed as tasks for the developer but some aspects can be reassigned to the instructor who developed Draft 1.

* Developer reviews all Draft 1 lessons
  * Check for flow of the narrative 
  * All figures should be centered and formatted (appropriate sizing)
  * Include additional figures if it is too text-heavy
  * Make sure all hyperlinks work
  * For advanced workshops, each lesson/step of workflow needs a workflow schematic at the top (under learning objectives)
  * Each lesson should have CCBY attribution listed at the bottom (see existing lessons)
* Create a schedule page and link all lessons
   * Include self-learning sections and pull-downs
   * Add answer keys section
