## Teaching workshop (protocol)

Some helpful notes here for first time teaching a workshop:

### Before-class prep

#### The day (or several days) before

1) **Decide who is teaching what in-class section(s) and self-learning sections, and become comfortable with your section(s)**
  * Install packages, run through code, save project for easy loading in class
  * Recognize where personal expertise will let you add to the material, or what can be skimmed over quickly
  * Familiarize yourself with concepts and anticipate where questions might arise
  * Identify sections where pausing to get green checkmarks or confirmation of understanding is prudent (such as prepping an R workspace, a chunk of R code, or an important concept)
  * Nice html versions of your class can be found in the linke directly below the *About* section on the righthand side of the main GitHub page for your class; these look more professional than presenting from the GitHub page directly
     * Familiarize yourself with any exercises and make sure you understand the answers
     * Answers to in-class exercise can be found in the links labeled *Answer Key* towards the bottom of the *schedule* page for the workshop on GitHub
     * Answers to self-lerning exercises can be found in the *exercises* folder on the GitHub repo for the workshop
      
#### The day of

0) **Consider doing these tasks in tandem with your teaching partner**
1) **Decide who will answer which [Poll Everywhere](https://pollev.com/hbctraining945) and email questions, if any**
   * Often, people don't submit questions until the night before or the morning before class, so check this 30-60 min before class
   * You may not know the answer off the top of your head and will need to do some prep
   * If a question is too time consuming to find an answer before/during class, you can always answer after class
   * These questions can help determine which self-learning sections to focus on       
2) **Review class homework submissions**
   * Homeworks can be found by searching for your class in [the HBC google forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/?tgif=d). Student answers can be found by clicking on the *Responses* tab
   * Correct answers to homeworks can be found in the *homework* folder in the Github repo for your course
   * Most people don't submit homework until the night before, so check this 30-60 min before class 
   * This will help you determine what self-learning areas need to be focused on in class
3) **Familiarize yourself with the polls for your sections**
   * Polls (and their answers) can be found in the *activities* folder of the GitHub repo for your class; 
   * Answers to polls can be found in the github repo for individual classes
4) **Pull up materials you will need for the class**
   * Links to your sections and self-learning materials
   * R, with your section project loaded
   * Homework responses, if there is a particular issue you want to address
   * Poll answer keys
5) **Log in to the zoom about 15 minutes early to discuss any issues with your teaching partner**
     * Open *Participants* and *Chat* windows so you can let people in from the waiting room, see green checkmarks, and see questions

### During class: introduction

1) **Encourage students to ask questions, but not to DM whoever is actively teaching**

### During class: self-learning discussion

1) **Ask for questions about that section before beginning; consider asking if this section was the one people struggled with the most if indicated by homework submission**
    * Encourage people to ask questions during the section
2) **Initate the poll for this section**
    * Give people a few minutes to answer questions
    * Share results of poll with the class
    * Go through the answers
3) **Briefly go through self-learning section, focusing on areas of need based on homeworks/polls, and conceptually important sections**
    * Pause and ask for questions
4)  **After all self learning sections are done, consider taking a bio-break before starting the in-class portion**

### During class: in-class lesson

#### Actively teaching:

 * Ask for green checkmarks where appropriate (such as prepping an R workspace, a chunk of R code, or an important concept)
 * Include your own expertise and experience as part of the lesson where appropriate (but avoid going on long tangents)
 * Ask for students to volunteer answers to exercises and discuss answers; discuss why incorrect answers are incorrect

#### Troubleshooting/Not actively teaching:

 * Consider asking, where appropriate, a relevant question if there is something of interest the speaker has forgotten or could elaborate on
 * Point out to the speaker if there is a question in the chat, or ask the question yourself
 * Field private questions; occasionally some private questions are appropriate for the whole class and you can offer those types of questions up to the speaker
